Flye assembler
==============

[![BioConda Install](https://img.shields.io/conda/dn/bioconda/flye.svg?style=flag&label=BioConda%20install)](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/flye)

### Version: 2.5

Flye is a de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads,
such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
It is designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects
to large mammalian-scale assemblies. The package represents a complete
pipeline: it takes raw PB / ONT reads as input and outputs polished contigs.
Flye also includes a special mode for metagenome assembly.

Latest updates

Repeat graph
------------

Flye is using repeat graph as a core data structure. 
In difference to de Bruijn graphs (which require exact k-mer matches),
repeat graphs are built using approximate sequence matches, and
can tolerate higher noise of SMS reads.

The edges of repeat graph represent genomic sequence, and nodes define
the junctions. Each edges is classified into unique or repetitive.
The genome traverses the graph (in an unknown way), so as each unique
edge appears exactly once in this traversal. Repeat graphs reveal the
repeat structure of the genome, which helps to reconstruct an optimal assembly.

Above is an example of the repeat graph of a bacterial assembly.
Each edge is labeled with its id, length and coverage. Repetitive edges are shown
in color, and unique edges are black. Note that each edge is represented in 
two copies: forward and reverse complement (marked with +/- signs), 
therefore the entire genome is represented in two copies. This is necessary
because the orientation of input reads is unknown.

In this example, there are two unresolved repeats: (i) a red repeat of 
multiplicity two and length 35k and (ii) a green repeat cluster of multiplicity
three and length 34k - 36k. As the repeats remained unresolved, there are no reads
in the dataset that cover those repeats in full. Five unique edges 
will correspond to five contigs in the final assembly.

Repeat graphs produced by Flye could be visualized using
[AGB](https://github.com/almiheenko/AGB) or [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage).

The assemblies generated using Flye 2.5 could be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3353665).
All datasets were run with default parameters with the following exceptions:
CHM13 T2T was run with `--min-overlap 10000`; CHM1 was run with `--asm-overage 40`;
HG002 was run with maximum read error rate set to 1%.
